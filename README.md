# Twitter Emotion Classification using BERT

This project implements a text classification model using **BERT** to classify Twitter messages into six emotion categories:

- 😢 Sadness  
- 😄 Joy  
- ❤️ Love  
- 😡 Anger  
- 😨 Fear  
- 😲 Surprise  

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore **emotion classification** in short texts using the **BERT** model from Hugging Face's `transformers` library. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of tweets to detect the underlying emotion in each message.

We use the [Emotions Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dair-ai/emotion) of Twitter messages for training and evaluation.
